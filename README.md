## Introduction to Parkinson's Disease

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects dopamine-producing neurons in a specific area of the brain. It is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. PD progresses through five stages and affects a significant number of individuals worldwide, including over 1 million people annually in India. Currently, there is no known cure for Parkinson's disease.

## What is XGBoost?

XGBoost, which stands for "eXtreme Gradient Boosting," is a highly efficient and flexible open-source library that implements the gradient boosting algorithm. It is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. XGBoost is known for its speed and performance, making it a popular choice for various machine learning tasks, especially with structured data. In this project, we utilize `XGBClassifier`, which is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for classification tasks using XGBoost.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting the presence of Parkinson's disease in individuals based on various voice measurements.

## About the Project

This Python machine learning project leverages several key libraries: `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing and model evaluation, `numpy` for numerical operations, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `xgboost` for building the classification model.

The project workflow involves the following main stages:

* **Data Loading:** Reading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
* **Feature and Label Separation:** Distinguishing between input features and the target variable (status indicating Parkinson's presence).
* **Data Scaling:** Normalizing the features to a specific range to improve model performance.
* **Dataset Splitting:** Dividing the data into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
* **Model Training:** Initializing and training an `XGBClassifier` on the training data.
* **Prediction and Evaluation:** Making predictions on the test set and calculating the model's accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **UCI ML Parkinsons dataset**.

* **Source:** You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/parkinsons-disease-detection).
* **File Name:** `parkinsons.data`
* **Characteristics:** It contains 24 columns and 195 records, with a relatively small file size of 39.7 KB. The 'status' column is the target variable, where `1` indicates the presence of Parkinson's and `0` indicates its absence.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python installed along with the following libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost

```
This project is designed to be run in a Jupyter environment, such as Google Colab. If you prefer a local setup, you'll need Jupyter Lab:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
This command will open JupyterLab in your web browser.
